"""
Use the standard BFS to calculate the shortest Distance
If the distance from vertx u to v is smaller than current distance of v, then update the distance

Refer : Leetcode/Graph/BFS_DFS/shortest_path_unweighted_graph.py

The above works only in case of 1 unit distance between each node

Otherwise you would need to check for each node without using visited list
